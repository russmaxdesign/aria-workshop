# HTML5, Accessible forms and ARIA

This repo contains slides and exercises for the "HTML5, Accessible forms and ARIA" workshop run by Russ Weakley.

This workshop takes a detailed look at WAI ARIA including what it is and why it is important for all front-end developers to understand. This workshop is designed for anyone who builds or tests complex web applications. The workshop includes a wide range of hands-on exercises which are HTML-based, so a basic understanding of HTML is required.

These materials can be out together in different ways, to create a single-day or two-day workshop.
